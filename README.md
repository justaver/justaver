# Joseph King - College Portfolio

## ðŸŽ“ Education

- **University Name**: Virginia Commonwealth University
- **Degree**: Electrical Engineering
- **Year**: 2026

## ðŸ“š Completed Coursework

### 1. **Circutis 1/circuts 2/ circuits 3** 
   - AC/DC Analysis (Cicuits 1)
   - Transfer functions, Op Amps, Filters (Circuits 2)
   - Diode Aanlysis, MOSFET Analysis, CMOS Analysis (Circuts 3)
   - Project 1: Simple circuit design & construction. 
   - Project 2: Created a cicuit using filters,
   - Project 3: Created a circuit design to operate a MOSFET in the saturation region.

### 4. **Advanced C programming**
   - Topics covered: Data structures, stacks , Tress, 
   - Project: A simple program that helpls us understand data structures, stacks, and memoery allocation. The project is called "Gbag", we essentially put contents in a bag (funtions) and when we take the contents out of the bag (call the function), it's expeced that the contents should do what they were programmed to do.

### 5. **Microcomputers**
   - Assembly language, CPU architecture, registers and memory.
   - Project: Created a robot that follows a black line.
